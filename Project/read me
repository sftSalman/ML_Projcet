We love cricket and the most loving cricket
format is T20. T20 world cup is knocking the
door in India and we are eagerly waiting for the
event. Every cricket lover wants to know the
winning team of the tournament but this
cannot be possible before plying the game. In
this case we can use machine learning for
advance predating. We have used different
types of machine learning algorithm for getting
better result. We achieved 64% accuracy in
logistic Regression that is very effective for t20
matches. Otherâ€™s machine Learning algorithm
used: Random Forest, KNN, Support vector
machine. Our prediction is tested properly and
we found a good outcome for prediction in
different case
